# Rack Integration

## Rack Environment

Actions offer a high level API built on top of Rack.
If we need to access raw data from Rack environment we can use `params.env`.

## Rack Middleware

Hanami mounts a very thin default middleware stack.
Additional components can be mounted globally, at the application level, or locally.

### Global Middleware

If we need a component that wraps all the applications (under `apps/`), we can edit `config.ru` at the root of the project.

```ruby
# config.ru
require './config/environment'
require 'rack/auth/basic'

use Rack::Auth::Basic
run Hanami.app
```

### Application Middleware

If we need a component that's only used by a specific application (under `apps/`), we can add it to the application's configuration.

```ruby
# apps/web/application.rb
require 'rack/auth/basic'

module Web
  class Application < Hanami::Application
    configure do
      # ...
      middleware.use Rack::Auth::Basic
    end
  end
end
```

### Action Middleware

Sometimes we need a middleware only to be used for a set of well known resources.
If we mount it at the global or application level the performance will start to degrade.
Actions allow us to mount a fine grained middleware stack.

```ruby
# apps/web/controllers/sessions/create.rb
require 'omniauth'

module Web::Controllers::Sessions
  class Create
    include Web::Action

    use OmniAuth::Builder {
      # ...
    }

    def call(params)
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```

We can use the following syntax to mount different middleware that require arguments.

```ruby
# apps/web/controllers/dashboard/index.rb
module Web::Controllers::Dashboard
  class Index
    include Web::Action

    use XMiddleware.new('x', 123)
    use YMiddleware.new
    use ZMiddleware

    def call(params)
      # ...
    end
  end
end
```
