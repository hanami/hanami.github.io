# Version

By running `hanami version` we can see the current version of the framework that we are using.

```shell
% bundle exec hanami version
v<%= hanami_version %>
```

There are also `--version` and `-v` aliases.

```shell
% bundle exec hanami --version
v<%= hanami_version %>

% bundle exec hanami -v
v<%= hanami_version %>
```
