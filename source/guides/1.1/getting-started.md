  <p>
    Hello. If you're reading this page, it's very likely that you want to learn more about Hanami.
    That's great, congrats! If you're looking for new ways to build maintainable, secure, faster and testable web applications, you're in good hands.
  </p>

  <p>
    <strong>Hanami is built for people like you.</strong>
  </p>

  <p>
    I warn you that whether you're a total beginner or an experienced developer <strong>this learning process can be hard</strong>.
    Over time, we build expectations about how things should be, and it can be painful to change. <strong>But without change, there is no challenge</strong> and without challenge, there is no growth.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sometimes a feature doesn't look right, that doesn't mean it's you.
    It can be a matter of formed habits, a design fallacy or even a bug.

  <p>
    Myself and the rest of the Community are putting best efforts to make Hanami better every day.
  </p>

  <p>
    In this guide we will set up our first Hanami project and build a simple bookshelf web application.
    We'll touch on all the major components of Hanami framework, all guided by tests.

## Prerequisites

Before we get started, let's get some prerequisites out of the way.
First, we're going to assume a basic knowledge of developing web applications.

You should also be familiar with [Bundler](http://bundler.io), [Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org), working with a terminal and building apps using the [Model, View, Controller](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) paradigm.

Lastly, in this guide we'll be using a [SQLite](https://sqlite.org/) database.
If you want to follow along, make sure you have a working installation of Ruby 2.3+ and SQLite 3+ on your system.

## Create a New Hanami Project

To create a new Hanami project, we need to install the Hanami gem from Rubygems.
Then we can use the new `hanami` executable to generate a new project:

```
% gem install hanami
% hanami new bookshelf
```

<p class="notice">
  By default, the project will be setup to use a SQLite database. For real-world projects, you can specify your engine:
  <code>
  % hanami new bookshelf --database=postgres
  </code>
</p>

This will create a new directory `bookshelf` in our current location.
Let's see what it contains:

```
% cd bookshelf
% tree -L 1
.
├── Gemfile
├── Rakefile
├── apps
├── config
├── config.ru
├── db
├── lib
├── public
└── spec

6 directories, 3 files
```

Here's what we need to know:

* `Gemfile` defines our Rubygems dependencies (using Bundler).
* `Rakefile` describes our Rake tasks.
* `apps` contains one or more web applications compatible with Rack.
  Here we can find the first generated Hanami application called `Web`.
  It's the place where we find our controllers, views, routes and templates.
* `config` contains configuration files.
* `config.ru` is for Rack servers.
* `db` contains our database schema and migrations.
* `lib` contains our business logic and domain model, including entities and repositories.
* `public` will contain compiled static assets.
* `spec` contains our tests.

Go ahead and install our gem dependency with Bundler; then we can launch a development server:

```
% bundle install
% bundle exec hanami server
```

And... bask in the glory of your first Hanami project at
[http://localhost:2300](http://localhost:2300)! We should see a screen similar to this:

<p><img src="/images/welcome-page.png" alt="Hanami welcome page" class="img-responsive"></p>

## Hanami Architecture

Hanami architecture **can host several Hanami (and Rack) applications in the same Ruby process**.

These applications live under `apps/`.
Each of them can be a component of our product, such as the user facing web interface, the admin pane, metrics, HTTP API etc..

All these parts are a _delivery mechanism_ to the business logic that lives under `lib/`.
This is the place where our models are defined, and interact with each other to compose the **features** that our product provides.

Hanami architecture is heavily inspired by [Clean Architecture](https://blog.8thlight.com/uncle-bob/2012/08/13/the-clean-architecture.html).

## Writing Our First Test

The opening screen we see when we point our browser at our app, is a
default page which is displayed when there are no routes defined.

Hanami encourages [Behavior Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) (BDD) as a way to write web applications.
In order to get our first custom page to display, we'll write a high-level feature test:

```ruby
# spec/web/features/visit_home_spec.rb
require 'features_helper'

describe 'Visit home' do
  it 'is successful' do
    visit '/'

    page.body.must_include('Bookshelf')
  end
end
```

Note that, although Hanami is ready for a Behavior Driven Development workflow out of the box, **it is in no way bound to any particular testing framework** -- nor does it come with special integrations or libraries.

We'll go with [Minitest](https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest) here (which is the default), but we can use [RSpec](http://rspec.info) by creating the project with `--test=rspec` option.
Hanami will then generate helpers and stub files for it.

<p class="notice">
  Please check .env.test in case you need to tweak the database URL.
</p>

We have to migrate our schema in the test database by running:

```shell
% HANAMI_ENV=test bundle exec hanami db prepare
```

As you can see, we have set `HANAMI_ENV` environment variable to instruct our command about the environment to use.

### Following a Request

Now we have a test, we can see it fail:

```
% bundle exec rake test
Run options: --seed 44759

# Running:

F

Finished in 0.018611s, 53.7305 runs/s, 53.7305 assertions/s.

  1) Failure:
Homepage#test_0001_is successful [/Users/hanami/bookshelf/spec/web/features/visit_home_spec.rb:6]:
Expected "<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>Not Found</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <h1>Not Found</h1>\n  </body>\n</html>\n" to include "Bookshelf".

1 runs, 1 assertions, 1 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

Now let's make it pass.
Lets add the code required to make this test pass, step-by-step.

The first thing we need to add is a route:

```ruby
# apps/web/config/routes.rb
root to: 'home#index'
```

We pointed our application's root URL to the `index` action of the `home` controller (see the [routing guide](/guides/1.1/routing/overview) for more information).
Now we can create the index action.

```ruby
# apps/web/controllers/home/index.rb
module Web::Controllers::Home
  class Index
    include Web::Action

    def call(params)
    end
  end
end
```

This is an empty action that doesn't implement any business logic.
Each action has a corresponding view, which is a Ruby object and needs to be added in order to complete the request.

```ruby
# apps/web/views/home/index.rb
module Web::Views::Home
  class Index
    include Web::View
  end
end
```

...which, in turn, is empty and does nothing more than render its template.
This is the file we need to edit in order to make our test pass. All we need to do is add the bookshelf heading.

```erb
# apps/web/templates/home/index.html.erb
<h1>Bookshelf</h1>
```

Save your changes, run your test again and it now passes. Great!

```shell
Run options: --seed 19286

# Running:

.

Finished in 0.011854s, 84.3600 runs/s, 168.7200 assertions/s.

1 runs, 2 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

## Generating New Actions

Let's use our new knowledge about the major Hanami components to add a new action.
The purpose of our Bookshelf project is to manage books.

We'll store books in our database and let the user manage them with our project.
A first step would be to show a listing of all the books in our system.

Let's write a new feature test describing what we want to achieve:

```ruby
# spec/web/features/list_books_spec.rb
require 'features_helper'

describe 'List books' do
  it 'displays each book on the page' do
    visit '/books'

    within '#books' do
      assert page.has_css?('.book', count: 2), 'Expected to find 2 books'
    end
  end
end
```

The test is simple enough, and fails because the URL `/books` is not currently recognised in our application. We'll create a new controller action to fix that.

### Hanami Generators

Hanami ships with various **generators** to save on typing some of the code involved in adding new functionality.
In our terminal, enter:

```
% bundle exec hanami generate action web books/index
```

This will generate a new action _index_ in the _books_ controller of the _web_ application.
It gives us an empty action, view and template; it also adds a default route to `apps/web/config/routes.rb`:

```ruby
get '/books', to: 'books#index'
```

If you're using ZSH, you may get `zsh: no matches found: books#index`. In that case, you can use:
```
% hanami generate action web books/index
```

To make our test pass, we need to edit our newly generated template file in `apps/web/templates/books/index.html.erb`:

```html
<h1>Bookshelf</h1>
<h2>All books</h2>

<div id="books">
  <div class="book">
    <h3>Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture</h3>
    <p>by <strong>Martin Fowler</strong></p>
  </div>

  <div class="book">
    <h3>Test Driven Development</h3>
    <p>by <strong>Kent Beck</strong></p>
  </div>
</div>
```

Save your changes and see your tests pass! The output will also contain a skipped test. This is due to an autogenerated test in `spec/web/views/books/index_spec.rb`.

The terminology of controllers and actions might be confusing, so let's clear this up: actions form the basis of our Hanami applications; controllers are mere modules that group several actions together.
So while the "controller" is _conceptually_ present in our project, in practice we only deal with actions.

We've used a generator to create a new endpoint in our application.
But one thing you may have noticed is that our new template contains the same `<h1>` as our `home/index.html.erb` template.
Let's fix that.

### Layouts

To avoid repeating ourselves in every single template, we can use a layout.
Open up the file `apps/web/templates/application.html.erb` and edit it to look like this:

```rhtml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Bookshelf</title>
    <%= favicon %>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>Bookshelf</h1>
    <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
```

Now you can remove the duplicate lines from the other templates. Let's run the tests again to check that everything worked fine.

A **layout** is like any other template, but it is used to wrap your regular templates.
The `yield` line is replaced with the contents of our regular template.
It's the perfect place to put our repeating headers and footers.

## Modeling Our Data With Entities

Hard-coding books in our templates is, admittedly, kind of cheating.
Let's add some dynamic data to our application.

We'll store books in our database and display them on our page.
To do so, we need a way to read and write to our database.
Enter entities and repositories:

* an **entity** is a domain object (eg. `Book`) uniquely identified by its identity.
* a **repository** mediates between entities and the persistence layer.

Entities are totally unaware of the database.
This makes them **lightweight** and **easy to test**.

For this reason we need a repository to persist the data that a `Book` depends on.
Read more about entities and repositories in the [models guide](/guides/1.1/models/overview).

Hanami ships with a generator for models, so let's use it to create a `Book` entity and the corresponding repository:

```
% bundle exec hanami generate model book
create  lib/bookshelf/entities/book.rb
create  lib/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository.rb
create  db/migrations/20161115110038_create_books.rb
create  spec/bookshelf/entities/book_spec.rb
create  spec/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository_spec.rb
```

The generator gives us an entity, a repository, a migration, and accompanying test files.

### Migrations To Change Our Database Schema

Let's modify the generated migration (the path to the migration will differ for you, because it contains a timestamp) to include `title` and `author` fields:

```ruby
# db/migrations/20161115110038_create_books.rb

Hanami::Model.migration do
  change do
    create_table :books do
      primary_key :id

      column :title,  String, null: false
      column :author, String, null: false

      column :created_at, DateTime, null: false
      column :updated_at, DateTime, null: false
    end
  end
end
```

Hanami provides a DSL to describe changes to our database schema. You can read more
about how migrations work in the [migrations' guide](/guides/1.1/migrations/overview).

In this case, we define a new table with columns for each of our entities' attributes.
Let's prepare our database for the development and test environments:

```
% bundle exec hanami db prepare
% HANAMI_ENV=test bundle exec hanami db prepare
```

### Working With Entities

An entity is something really close to a plain Ruby object.
We should focus on the behaviors that we want from it and only then, how to save it.

For now, we keep the generated entity class:

```ruby
# lib/bookshelf/entities/book.rb
class Book < Hanami::Entity
end
```

This class will generate getters and setters for each attribute which we pass to initialize params.
We can verify it all works as expected with a unit test:

```ruby
# spec/bookshelf/entities/book_spec.rb
require_relative '../../spec_helper'

describe Book do
  it 'can be initialized with attributes' do
    book = Book.new(title: 'Refactoring')
    book.title.must_equal 'Refactoring'
  end
end
```

### Using Repositories

Now we are ready to play around with our repository.
We can use Hanami's `console` command to launch IRb with our application pre-loaded, so we can use our objects:

```
% bundle exec hanami console
>> repository = BookRepository.new
=> => #<BookRepository relations=[:books]>
>> repository.all
=> []
>> book = repository.create(title: 'TDD', author: 'Kent Beck')
=> #<Book:0x007f9ab61c23b8 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>"TDD", :author=>"Kent Beck", :created_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC}>
>> repository.find(book.id)
=> #<Book:0x007f9ab6181610 @attributes={:id=>1, :title=>"TDD", :author=>"Kent Beck", :created_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC, :updated_at=>2016-11-15 11:11:38 UTC}>
```

Hanami repositories have methods to load one or more entities from our database; and to create and update existing records.
The repository is also the place where you would define new methods to implement custom queries.

To recap, we've seen how Hanami uses entities and repositories to model our data.
Entities represent our behavior, while repositories use mappings to translate our entities to our data store.
We can use migrations to apply changes to our database schema.

### Displaying Dynamic Data

With our new experience modelling data, we can get to work displaying dynamic data on our book listing page.
Let's adjust the feature test we created earlier:

```ruby
# spec/web/features/list_books_spec.rb
require 'features_helper'

describe 'List books' do
  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }
  before do
    repository.clear

    repository.create(title: 'PoEAA', author: 'Martin Fowler')
    repository.create(title: 'TDD',   author: 'Kent Beck')
  end

  it 'displays each book on the page' do
    visit '/books'

    within '#books' do
      assert page.has_css?('.book', count: 2), 'Expected to find 2 books'
    end
  end
end
```

We create the required records in our test and then assert the correct number of book classes on the page.
When we run this test it should pass. If it does not pass, a likely reason is that the test database was not migrated.

Now we can go change our template and remove the static HTML.
Our view needs to loop over all available records and render them.
Let's write a test to force this change in our view:

```ruby
# spec/web/views/books/index_spec.rb
require_relative '../../../spec_helper'

describe Web::Views::Books::Index do
  let(:exposures) { Hash[books: []] }
  let(:template)  { Hanami::View::Template.new('apps/web/templates/books/index.html.erb') }
  let(:view)      { Web::Views::Books::Index.new(template, exposures) }
  let(:rendered)  { view.render }

  it 'exposes #books' do
    view.books.must_equal exposures.fetch(:books)
  end

  describe 'when there are no books' do
    it 'shows a placeholder message' do
      rendered.must_include('<p class="placeholder">There are no books yet.</p>')
    end
  end

  describe 'when there are books' do
    let(:book1)     { Book.new(title: 'Refactoring', author: 'Martin Fowler') }
    let(:book2)     { Book.new(title: 'Domain Driven Design', author: 'Eric Evans') }
    let(:exposures) { Hash[books: [book1, book2]] }

    it 'lists them all' do
      rendered.scan(/class="book"/).count.must_equal 2
      rendered.must_include('Refactoring')
      rendered.must_include('Domain Driven Design')
    end

    it 'hides the placeholder message' do
      rendered.wont_include('<p class="placeholder">There are no books yet.</p>')
    end
  end
end
```

We specify that our index page will show a simple placeholder message when there are no books to display; when there are, it lists every one of them.
Note how rendering a view with some data is relatively straight-forward.
Hanami is designed around simple objects with minimal interfaces that are easy to test in isolation, yet still work great together.

Let's rewrite our template to implement these requirements:

```erb
# apps/web/templates/books/index.html.erb
<h2>All books</h2>

<% if books.any? %>
  <div id="books">
    <% books.each do |book| %>
      <div class="book">
        <h2><%= book.title %></h2>
        <p><%= book.author %></p>
      </div>
    <% end %>
  </div>
<% else %>
  <p class="placeholder">There are no books yet.</p>
<% end %>
```

If we run our feature test now, we'll see it fails — because our controller
action does not actually [_expose_](/guides/1.1/actions/exposures) the books to our view. We can write a test for
that change:

```ruby
# spec/web/controllers/books/index_spec.rb
require_relative '../../../spec_helper'

describe Web::Controllers::Books::Index do
  let(:action) { Web::Controllers::Books::Index.new }
  let(:params) { Hash[] }
  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }

  before do
    repository.clear

    @book = repository.create(title: 'TDD', author: 'Kent Beck')
  end

  it 'is successful' do
    response = action.call(params)
    response[0].must_equal 200
  end

  it 'exposes all books' do
    action.call(params)
    action.exposures[:books].must_equal [@book]
  end
end
```

Writing tests for controller actions is basically two-fold: you either assert on the response object, which is a Rack-compatible array of status, headers and content; or on the action itself, which will contain exposures after we've called it.
Now we've specified that the action exposes `:books`, we can implement our action:

```ruby
# apps/web/controllers/books/index.rb
module Web::Controllers::Books
  class Index
    include Web::Action

    expose :books

    def call(params)
      @books = BookRepository.new.all
    end
  end
end
```

By using the `expose` method in our action class, we can expose the contents of our `@books` instance variable to the outside world, so that Hanami can pass it to the view.
That's enough to make all our tests pass again!

```shell
% bundle exec rake
Run options: --seed 59133

# Running:

.........

Finished in 0.042065s, 213.9543 runs/s, 380.3633 assertions/s.

9 runs, 16 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 0 skips
```

## Building Forms To Create Records

One of the last remaining steps is to make it possible to add new books to the system.
The plan is simple: we build a page with a form to enter details.

When the user submits the form, we build a new entity, save it, and redirect the user back to the book listing.
Here's that story expressed in a test:

```ruby
# spec/web/features/add_book_spec.rb
require 'features_helper'

describe 'Add a book' do
  after do
    BookRepository.new.clear
  end

  it 'can create a new book' do
    visit '/books/new'

    within 'form#book-form' do
      fill_in 'Title',  with: 'New book'
      fill_in 'Author', with: 'Some author'

      click_button 'Create'
    end

    current_path.must_equal('/books')
    assert page.has_content?('New book')
  end
end
```

### Laying The Foundations For A Form

By now, we should be familiar with the working of actions, views and templates.

We'll speed things up a little, so we can quickly get to the good parts.
First, create a new action for our "New Book" page:

```
% bundle exec hanami generate action web books/new
```

This adds a new route to our app:

```ruby
# apps/web/config/routes.rb
get '/books/new', to: 'books#new'
```

The interesting bit will be our new template, because we'll be using Hanami's form builder to construct a HTML form around our `Book` entity.

### Using Form Helpers

Let's use [form helpers](/guides/1.1/helpers/forms) to build this form in `apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb`:

```erb
# apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb
<h2>Add book</h2>

<%=
  form_for :book, '/books' do
    div class: 'input' do
      label      :title
      text_field :title
    end

    div class: 'input' do
      label      :author
      text_field :author
    end

    div class: 'controls' do
      submit 'Create Book'
    end
  end
%>
```

We've added `<label>` tags for our form fields, and wrapped each field in a
container `<div>` using Hanami's [HTML builder helper](/guides/1.1/helpers/html5).

### Submitting Our Form

To submit our form, we need yet another action.
Let's create a `Books::Create` action:

```
% bundle exec hanami generate action web books/create
```

This adds a new route to our app:

```ruby
# apps/web/config/routes.rb
post '/books', to: 'books#create'
```

### Implementing Create Action

Our `books#create` action needs to do two things.
Let's express them as unit tests:

```ruby
# spec/web/controllers/books/create_spec.rb
require_relative '../../../spec_helper'

describe Web::Controllers::Books::Create do
  let(:action) { Web::Controllers::Books::Create.new }
  let(:params) { Hash[book: { title: 'Confident Ruby', author: 'Avdi Grimm' }] }
  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }

  before do
    repository.clear
  end

  it 'creates a new book' do
    action.call(params)
    book = repository.last

    book.id.wont_be_nil
    book.title.must_equal params.dig(:book, :title)
  end

  it 'redirects the user to the books listing' do
    response = action.call(params)

    response[0].must_equal 302
    response[1]['Location'].must_equal '/books'
  end
end
```

Let's make these tests pass!
We've already seen how we can write entities to our database, and we can use `redirect_to` to implement our redirection:

```ruby
# apps/web/controllers/books/create.rb
module Web::Controllers::Books
  class Create
    include Web::Action

    def call(params)
      BookRepository.new.create(params[:book])

      redirect_to '/books'
    end
  end
end
```

This minimal implementation should suffice to make our tests pass.

```shell
% bundle exec rake
Run options: --seed 63592

# Running:

...S.S.........

Finished in 0.081961s, 183.0142 runs/s, 305.0236 assertions/s.

15 runs, 23 assertions, 0 failures, 0 errors, 2 skips

You have skipped tests. Run with --verbose for details.
```

Congratulations!

### Securing Our Form With Validations

Hold your horses! We need some extra measures to build a truly robust form.
Imagine what would happen if the user were to submit the form without entering any values?

We could fill our database with bad data or see an exception for data integrity violations.
We clearly need a way of keeping invalid data out of our system!

To express our validations in a test, we need to wonder: what _would_ happen if our validations failed?
One option would be to re-render the `books#new` form, so we can give our users another shot at completing it correctly.
Let's specify this behaviour as unit tests:

```ruby
# spec/web/controllers/books/create_spec.rb
require_relative '../../../spec_helper'

describe Web::Controllers::Books::Create do
  let(:action) { Web::Controllers::Books::Create.new }
  let(:repository) { BookRepository.new }

  before do
    repository.clear
  end

  describe 'with valid params' do
    let(:params) { Hash[book: { title: 'Confident Ruby', author: 'Avdi Grimm' }] }

    it 'creates a book' do
      action.call(params)
      book = repository.last

      book.id.wont_be_nil
      book.title.must_equal params.dig(:book, :title)
    end

    it 'redirects the user to the books listing' do
      response = action.call(params)

      response[0].must_equal 302
      response[1]['Location'].must_equal '/books'
    end
  end

  describe 'with invalid params' do
    let(:params) { Hash[book: {}] }

    it 'returns HTTP client error' do
      response = action.call(params)
      response[0].must_equal 422
    end

    it 'dumps errors in params' do
      action.call(params)
      errors = action.params.errors

      errors.dig(:book, :title).must_equal  ['is missing']
      errors.dig(:book, :author).must_equal ['is missing']
    end
  end
end
```

Now our tests specify two alternative scenarios: our original happy path, and a new scenario in which validations fail.
To make our tests pass, we need to implement validations.

Although you can add validation rules to the entity, Hanami also allows you to define validation rules as close to the source of the input as possible, i.e. the action.
Hanami controller actions can use the `params` class method to define acceptable incoming parameters.

This approach both whitelists what params are used (others are discarded to prevent mass-assignment vulnerabilities from untrusted user input) _and_ adds rules to define what values are acceptable — in this case we've specified that the nested attributes for a book's title and author should be present.

With our validations in place, we can limit our entity creation and redirection to cases where the incoming params are valid:

```ruby
# apps/web/controllers/books/create.rb
module Web::Controllers::Books
  class Create
    include Web::Action

    expose :book

    params do
      required(:book).schema do
        required(:title).filled(:str?)
        required(:author).filled(:str?)
      end
    end

    def call(params)
      if params.valid?
        @book = BookRepository.new.create(params[:book])

        redirect_to '/books'
      else
        self.status = 422
      end
    end
  end
end
```

When the params are valid, the Book is created and the action redirects to a different URL.
But when the params are not valid, what happens?

First, the HTTP status code is set to
[422 (Unprocessable Entity)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_HTTP_status_codes#422).
Then the control will pass to the corresponding view, which needs to know which template to render.
In this case `apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb` will be used to render the form again.

```ruby
# apps/web/views/books/create.rb
module Web::Views::Books
  class Create
    include Web::View
    template 'books/new'
  end
end
```

This approach will work nicely because Hanami's form builder is smart enough to inspect the `params` in this action and populate the form fields with values found in the params.
If the user fills in only one field before submitting, they are presented with their original input, saving them the frustration of typing it again.

Run your tests again and see they are all passing again!

### Displaying Validation Errors

Rather than just shoving the user a form under their nose when something has gone wrong, we should give them a hint of what's expected of them. Let's adapt our form to show a notice about invalid fields.

First, we expect a list of errors to be included in the page when `params` contains errors:

```ruby
# spec/web/views/books/new_spec.rb
require_relative '../../../spec_helper'

describe Web::Views::Books::New do
  let(:params)    { OpenStruct.new(valid?: false, error_messages: ['Title must be filled', 'Author must be filled']) }
  let(:exposures) { Hash[params: params] }
  let(:template)  { Hanami::View::Template.new('apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb') }
  let(:view)      { Web::Views::Books::New.new(template, exposures) }
  let(:rendered)  { view.render }

  it 'displays list of errors when params contains errors' do
    rendered.must_include('There was a problem with your submission')
    rendered.must_include('Title must be filled')
    rendered.must_include('Author must be filled')
  end
end
```

We should also update our feature spec to reflect this new behavior:

```ruby
# spec/web/features/add_book_spec.rb
require 'features_helper'

describe 'Add a book' do
  # Spec written earlier omitted for brevity

  it 'displays list of errors when params contains errors' do
    visit '/books/new'

    within 'form#book-form' do
      click_button 'Create'
    end

    current_path.must_equal('/books')

    assert page.has_content?('There was a problem with your submission')
    assert page.has_content?('Title must be filled')
    assert page.has_content?('Author must be filled')
  end
end
```

In our template we can loop over `params.errors` (if there are any) and display a friendly message.
Open up `apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb` and add the following at the top of the file:

```erb
<% unless params.valid? %>
  <div class="errors">
    <h3>There was a problem with your submission</h3>
    <ul>
      <% params.error_messages.each do |message| %>
        <li><%= message %></li>
      <% end %>
    </ul>
  </div>
<% end %>
```

Run your tests again and see they are all passing again!

```shell
% bundle exec rake
Run options: --seed 59940

# Running:

### Improving Our Use Of The Router

The last improvement we are going to make, is in the use of our router.
Open up the routes file for the "web" application:

```ruby
# apps/web/config/routes.rb
post '/books',    to: 'books#create'
get '/books/new', to: 'books#new'
get '/books',     to: 'books#index'
root              to: 'home#index'
```

Hanami provides a convenient helper method to build these REST-style routes, that we can use to simplify our router a bit:

```ruby
root to: 'home#index'
resources :books, only: [:index, :new, :create]
```

To get a sense of what routes are defined, now we've made this change, you can
run `bundle exec hanami routes` on your command-line to inspect the end result:

```
% bundle exec hanami routes
     Name Method     Path                           Action

     root GET, HEAD  /                              Web::Controllers::Home::Index
    books GET, HEAD  /books                         Web::Controllers::Books::Index
 new_book GET, HEAD  /books/new                     Web::Controllers::Books::New
    books POST       /books                         Web::Controllers::Books::Create
```

The output shows you the name of the defined helper method (you can suffix this name with `_path` or `_url` and call it on the `routes` helper), the allowed HTTP method, the path and finally the controller action that will be used to handle the request.

Now we've applied the `resources` helper method, we can take advantage of the named route methods.
Remember how we built our form using `form_for` in `apps/web/templates/books/new.html.erb`?

```erb
<%=
  form_for :book, '/books' do
    # ...
  end
%>
```

We don't need to include a hard-coded path in our template, when our router is already perfectly aware of which route to point the form to.
We can use the `routes` helper method that is available in our views and actions to access route-specific helper methods:

```erb
<%=
  form_for :book, routes.books_path do
    # ...
  end
%>
```

We can make a similar change in `apps/web/controllers/books/create.rb`:

```ruby
redirect_to routes.books_path
```

## Wrapping Up

**Congratulations for completing your first Hanami project!**

Let's review what we've done: we've traced requests through Hanami's major frameworks to understand how they relate to each other; we've seen how we can model our domain using entities and repositories; we've seen solutions for building forms, maintaining our database schema, and validating user input.

We've come a long way, but there's still plenty more to explore.
Explore the [other guides](/guides/1.1), the [Hanami API documentation](http://www.rubydoc.info/gems/hanami), read the [source code](https://github.com/hanami) and follow the [blog](/blog).

**Above all, enjoy building amazing things!**
