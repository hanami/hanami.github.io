## Upgrade Notes for v0.8.0

  * Use Ruby 2.2+

  * Edit your `Gemfile`, by changing Hanami version: `gem 'hanami', '~> 0.8'`.

  * Create a group `:development` in `Gemfile` and add `gem 'shotgun'`

  * Create a group `:development, :test` in `Gemfile` and add `gem 'dotenv', '~> 2.0'`

  * Edit `.hanamirc` by adding a new key `project`. The value must be the snake_case name of the project. Eg. <code>project=active\_citizens</code>.

  * Edit `.env` files and change env variables in production from `<PROJECT>_DATABASE_URL` to `DATABASE_URL`.

  * Change params validation syntax. Learn more at [Hanami::Validations README](https://github.com/hanami/validations#usage).

  * Change params access syntax to symbols. Eg `params['book']` is no longer supported.

  * The returning value of `params.errors` has changed: now it's a Hash with key the attribute name and value an array of strings with error messages.

  * In views, layouts and templates use `#local` instead of `#content`, which is now deprecated.

  * [Optional] Edit [logging settings](/guides/applications/logging) in `apps/web/application.rb`.

  * [Optional] Add `security.x_content_type_options 'nosniff'` to `apps/web/application.rb`.

  * [Optional] Add `security.x_xss_protection '1; mode=block'` to `apps/web/application.rb`.

  * [Optional] Add `subresource_integrity :sha256` to `assets` block in `configure :production` to `apps/web/application.rb`.

  * [Optional] Minitest users can disable Rake 11 warnings by adding `t.warning = false` to the `Rake::TestTask.new do |t|` block in `Rakefile`

  * [Optional] RSpec users can disable Rake 11 warnings by adding `config.warnings = false ` to the `RSpec.configure |config|` block in <code>spec/spec\_helper.rb</code>.
