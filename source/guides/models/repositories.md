# Repositories

An object that mediates between entities and the persistence layer.
It offers a standardized API to query and execute commands on a database.

A repository is **storage independent**, all the queries and commands are
delegated to the current adapter.

This architecture has several advantages:

  * Applications depend on a standard API, instead of low level details
    (Dependency Inversion principle)

  * Applications depend on a stable API, that doesn't change if the
    storage changes

  * Developers can postpone storage decisions

  * Confines persistence logic at a low level

  * Multiple data sources can easily coexist in an application

## Interface

When a class includes `Hanami::Repository`, its objects will receive the following interface:

  * `#persist(entity)` – Create or update an entity
  * `#create(entity)`  – Create a record for the given entity
  * `#update(entity)`  – Update the record corresponding to the given entity
  * `#delete(entity)`  – Delete the record corresponding to the given entity
  * `#fetch(raw)`  – Fetch raw datasets for the given raw query string (eg. SQL)
  * `#execute(raw)`  – Execute raw command (eg. SQL)
  * `#all`   - Fetch all the entities from the collection
  * `#find`  - Fetch an entity from the collection by its ID
  * `#first` - Fetch the first entity from the collection
  * `#last`  - Fetch the last entity from the collection
  * `#clear` - Delete all the records from the collection
  * `#query` - Fabricates a query object

Note that these methods are instance methods therefore are called after a new repository object has been created with
`.new`.

**A collection is a homogenous set of records.**
It corresponds to a table for a SQL database or to a MongoDB collection.

## Private Queries

**All the queries are private**.
This decision forces developers to define intention revealing API, instead of leaking storage API details outside of a repository.

Look at the following code:

```ruby
BookRepository.new.where(author_id: 23).order(:published_at).limit(8)
```

This is **bad** for a variety of reasons:

  * The caller has an intimate knowledge of the internal mechanisms of the Repository.

  * The caller works on several levels of abstraction.

  * It doesn't express a clear intent, it's just a chain of methods.

  * The caller can't be easily tested in isolation.

  * If we change the storage, we are forced to change the code of the caller(s).

There is a better way:

```ruby
# lib/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository.rb

class BookRepository
  include Hanami::Repository

  def most_recent_by_author(author, limit: 8)
    query do
      where(author_id: author.id).
        order(:published_at)
    end.limit(limit)
  end
end
```

This is a **huge improvement**, because:

  * The caller doesn't know how the repository fetches the entities.

  * The caller works on a single level of abstraction. It doesn't even know about records, only works with entities.

  * It expresses a clear intent.

  * The caller can be easily tested in isolation. It's just a matter of stubbing this method.

  * If we change the storage, the callers aren't affected.

Now we can get all books from an author ordered by date, and we can also supply an optional limit, with only one method call.
We can do this by calling `BookRepository.new.most_recent_by_author(author, 20)`.

## Raw Queries & Commands

A repository can perform queries and commands by accepting raw query language expressions.

### Fetch

```ruby
# lib/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository.rb
class BookRepository
  include Hanami::Repository

  def raw_all
    fetch("SELECT * FROM books")
  end

  def find_all_titles
    fetch("SELECT title FROM books").map do |book|
      book[:title]
    end
  end

  def max_price
    result = 0

    fetch("SELECT price FROM books") do |book|
      result = book[:price] if book[:price] > result
    end

    result
  end
end
```

When `#fetch` is used, the returning value is NOT a collection of entities (eg. `Book`), BUT an array of hashes that represents the **raw result set**.

<p class="warning">
  Do NOT use user input with <code>.fetch</code>, because it makes your app vulnerable to SQL Injection.
</p>

### Execute

```ruby
# lib/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository.rb
class BookRepository
  include Hanami::Repository

  def reset_download_count
    execute("UPDATE books SET download_count = 0")
  end
end
```

To ensure a command/query separation, `#execute` doesn't have a returning value.

<p class="warning">
  Do NOT use user input with <code>.execute</code>, because it makes your app vulnerable to SQL Injection.
</p>

## Extended Example

Here is an extended example of a repository that uses the SQL adapter.

```ruby
# lib/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository.rb
class BookRepository
  include Hanami::Repository

  def most_recent_by_author(author, limit: 8)
    query do
      where(author_id: author.id).
        desc(:id).
        limit(limit)
    end
  end

  def most_recent_published_by_author(author, limit = 8)
    most_recent_by_author(author, limit).published
  end

  def published
    query do
      where(published: true)
    end
  end

  def drafts
    exclude published
  end

  def rank
    published.desc(:comments_count)
  end

  def best_article_ever
    rank.limit(1)
  end

  def comments_average
    query.average(:comments_count)
  end
end
```

## Reuse Code

You can also extract the common logic from your repository into a module to reuse it in other repositories.
Here is a pagination example:

```ruby
# lib/bookshelf/repositories/pagination.rb
module Bookshelf
  module Repositories
    module Pagination
      def paginate(limit: 10, offset: 0)
        query do
          limit(limit).offset(offset)
        end
      end
    end
  end
end
```

```ruby
# lib/bookshelf/repositories/book_repository.rb
class BookRepository
  include Hanami::Repository
  include Bookshelf::Repositories::Pagination

  def published
    query do
      where(published: true)
    end.paginate
  end
end
```
