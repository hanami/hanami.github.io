After more than three years of work, Hanami 2.0 is here! This release marks a new era for Hanami, and presents a revolutionary new vision for Ruby applications!

Hanami 2.0 is jam packed with goodies:

- A **state of the art new application core** offering advanced code loading capabilities
- An **always-there dependencies mixin**, helping you draw clearer connections between your app's components
- A **blazing fast new router**
- Redesigned **functional action classes** that integrate seamlessly with your app's business logic
- **Type-safe app settings** with dotenv integration, ensuring your app has everything it needs in every environment
- New **providers** for flexibly managing the lifecycle of your app's critical components and integrations
- New built-in **slices** for gradual modularisation as your app grows
- A **rewritten getting started guide** to help you get going with all of the above

To build Hanami 2.0, we’ve brought together with the [dry-rb][dry-rb] and [rom-rb][rom-rb] teams, and together we’re very proud to present BLAH BLAH brought together the best of all of these libraries and provide you with a curated, easy-to-start experience.

With 2.0 Hanami apps are no longer just for the web: Hanami is now **the everything framework** for Rubyists. By removing just a few lines from your `Gemfile`, you can have everything you need and nothing you don’t. Remove the router and controller, for example, and you can build a chatbot or a Kafka consumer and still take advantage of all the other conveniences of Hanami.

There’s a lot here, and we can’t wait for you to try it out. Let’s take a look at the highlights in more detail.
