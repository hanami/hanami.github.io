  Previewing front end assets for Hanami 2.1.
---

Today we’re excited to release Hanami 2.1.0.beta2 and share a preview of Hanami’s front end assets experience.

It all starts with a new command: `hanami dev`.

Running `hanami dev` starts the familiar Hanami web server alongside our new front end assets watcher and compiler. This is based on [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io), and uses a [brand new plugin](https://github.com/hanami/assets-js) to make it aware of Hanami’s app structure.

Your assets live in `app/assets/`. JavaScript files live under `js/` and serve as your main entry points. Here’s an example:

```ts
# app/assets/app.ts

import "../css/app.css";

console.log("Hello from app.ts");
```

As you can see, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) support comes out of the box.

With your initial assets files in place, you can hop over to your view layout to include them:

```erb
# app/views/layouts/app.html.erb

<html>
  <head>
    <%= css "app" %>
    <%= js "app" %>
  </head>
  <body>
    <%= yield %>
  </body>
</html>
```

And with that, you’re done! Your app is now serving your custom styles and JavaScript behavior.

We provide a [complete range of helpers](https://github.com/hanami/hanami/blob/ccf1a264e28afd3b0072af746d64af733e173b5e/lib/hanami/helpers/assets_helper.rb#L1) for working with your assets in various ways, including `js`, `css` (or their wordier equivalents, `javascript_tag`, `stylesheet_link_tag`) `asset_url`, `image_tag` and more.

For users of Hanami slices, we have you covered too: assets can live within each slice, in `slices/[slice_name]/assets` directories that can take the same structure as the app-level assets.

Along with the `hanami dev` command, you can also use the `hanami assets compile` and `hanami assets watch` commands directly. We also provide an `assets:precompile` rake task for compatibility with PaaS hosting providers that expect this task of Ruby apps.

If you’ve been waiting for the full stack Hanami experience, this beta release is a huge step forward.

Since our assets support is brand new, we need your help! We’d love you to give this a try with your favorite front end tools and packages, and [let us know how you go](https://discourse.hanamirb.org).

## What’s next for 2.1?

From here, we’ll be working through the small number of “Todo” items remaining on our [Hanami v2.1 proejct board](https://github.com/orgs/hanami/projects/2/views/1). These are mostly just polish and preparation tasks.

Depending on what we learn from your testing and feedback, this means the full 2.1 release may only be a matter of weeks away! We’ll also be focusing on getting our docs ready to go as well, and we’ll begin to release these as soon as they start to come together.
