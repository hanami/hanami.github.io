  Previewing front end assets for Hanami 2.1 and our new CLI command: hanami dev.
---

**Today we’re excited to release Hanami 2.1.0.beta2 and share a preview of Hanami’s front end assets experience.**

## `hanami dev`

It all starts with a new command: `hanami dev`.

Running `hanami dev` starts the familiar Hanami web server alongside our new **front end assets watcher and compiler**. This is based on [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io), and uses a [brand new plugin](https://github.com/hanami/assets-js) to make it aware of Hanami’s app structure.

Hanami’s assets support now requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com) to work.

## App structure for assets

Your assets live in `app/assets/`. JavaScript files live under `js/` and serve as your main entry points.

Here’s an example `app/assets/app.ts`:

```ts
import "../css/app.css";

console.log("Hello from app.ts");
```

As you can see, [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org) support comes out of the box. Just run `npm install typescript --save-dev`.

With your initial assets files in place, you can hop over to your view layout to include them:

`app/views/layouts/app.html.erb`

```erb
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Bookshelf</title>
    <%= favicon %>
    <%= css "app" %>
  </head>
  <body>
    <%= yield %>
    <%= js "app" %>
  </body>
</html>
```

And with that, you’re done! Your app is now serving your custom styles and JavaScript behavior.

## View helpers for assets

We provide a [complete range of helpers](https://github.com/hanami/hanami/blob/965aa5aeb25b0a16b9c519866f14b4fa916d290a/lib/hanami/helpers/assets_helper.rb#L1) for working with your assets in various ways, including `js`, `css` (or their fuller equivalents, `javascript` and `stylesheet`) `asset_url`, `image` and more.

## Assets for slices

For users of Hanami slices, we have you covered too: assets can live within each slice, in `slices/[slice_name]/assets` directories that can take the same structure as the app-level assets.

## CLI commands

Along with the `hanami dev` command, you can also use the `hanami assets compile` and `hanami assets watch` commands directly.

## We need your help!

If you’ve been waiting for the full stack Hanami experience, this beta release is a huge step forward.

Since our assets support is brand new, we need your help! We’d love you to give this a try with your favorite front end tools and packages, and [let us know how you go](https://discourse.hanamirb.org).

## What’s included?

Today we’re releasing the following gems:

- hanami v2.1.0.beta2
- hanami-reloader v2.1.0.beta2
- hanami-webconsole v2.1.0.beta2
- hanami-cli v2.1.0.beta2
- hanami-assets v2.1.0.beta2

## How can I try it?

```shell

> gem install hanami --pre
> hanami new my_app
> cd my_app
> bundle exec hanami dev
```

## What’s next for 2.1?

From here, we’ll be working through the small number of “Todo” items remaining on our [Hanami v2.1 project board](https://github.com/orgs/hanami/projects/2/views/1). These are mostly just polish and preparation tasks.

Depending on what we learn from your testing and feedback, this means **the full 2.1 release may only be a matter of weeks away!** We’ll also be focusing on getting our docs ready to go as well, and we’ll begin to release these as soon as they start to come together.
