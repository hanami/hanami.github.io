## Minor Changes

`v1.0.0.rc1` is a patch release for few bug fixes and small changes:

- Let `Hanami::Mailer.deliver` to bubble up `ArgumentError` exceptions
- Allow `logger` setting in `config/environment.rb` to accept arbitrary arguments to make `Hanami::Logger` to be compatible with Ruby's `Logger`. (eg. `logger 'daily', level: :info`)
- Ensure code reloading don't misconfigure mailer settings (regression from `v1.0.0.beta3`)
- Ensure database disconnection to happen in the same thread of `Hanami.boot`
- Ensure `mailer` block in `config/environment.rb` to be evaluated multiple times, according to the current Hanami environment
- Ensure a Hanami project to require only once the code under `lib/`
