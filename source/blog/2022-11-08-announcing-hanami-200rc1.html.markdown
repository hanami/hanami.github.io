  First Release Candidate! Preparing for stable release.

Hello, folks!
We're close to the stable version of Hanami 2!
We consider Hanami 2 done.
Today's Release Candidate (RC) 2.0.0.rc1 is hopefully the last step before to achieve this great milestone.

## Small changes

We've spent much of this release's development cycle getting everything as tidy as possible. Here are a few highlights:

- Use Zeitwerk to auto-load Hanami
- Introduce `Hanami::Slice.stop` to properly shutdown all the application slices
- Ensure to properly mount Rack middleware in routing scope and slice
- Simplify and clarify usage of `Hanami::Config#enviroment`
- Improve error message for missing action class
- Expect nested slices to use parentâ€™s namespace
- Remove duplicated configuration `config.session` and keep `config.actions.sessions`
- Fixed `hanami routes` inspection of nested named routes
- Simplify assignment of response format: `response.format = :json` (was `response.format = format(:json)`)
- Removed `Hanami::Logger` from `hanami-utils` in favor of `Dry::Logger` from `dry-logger` new gem
- Ensure `Hanami::Utils::String.underscore` to replace `"."` (dot character) to `"_"` (underscore)

## 2.0.0 is coming!

**Expect 2.0.0 in two weeks.**

Since last Hanami beta version, we released stable versions of all dry-rb gems.

Soon, the Ruby ecosystem will have set of modern, **stable** libraries and frameworks to build the next generation applications.

Between now and then, we need your help: please take the chance to test Hanami 2.0! Pull down this RC and give things a go, and let us know if you hit any issues.
