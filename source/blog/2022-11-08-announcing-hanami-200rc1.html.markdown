  First Release Candidate! Preparing for stable release.
---

Hello, folks!

Weâ€™re very close to the stable version of Hanami 2!
We now consider Hanami 2 done.
Todayâ€™s Release Candidate (RC) 2.0.0.rc1 is hopefully the last step before we achieve this great milestone.

## Small changes

Weâ€™ve spent much of this releaseâ€™s development cycle getting everything as tidy as possible. Here are a few highlights:

- Allow Rack middleware to be mounted directly inside routing scopes and slice scopes
- Introduce `Hanami::App.environment` (and `Hanami::Slice.environment`) to run setup code inside a particular environment only
- Simplify assignment of response format: `response.format = :json` (was `response.format = format(:json)`)
- Improve error messages for missing action class
- Remove duplicated `config.sessions` in favor of `config.actions.sessions`
- Fix `hanami routes` inspection of nested named routes
- Introduce `Hanami::Slice.stop` to properly shutdown all the application slices
- Expect/define nested slices to be within their parentâ€™s namespace
- Use Zeitwerk to auto-load the `hanami` gemâ€™s internal classes
- Remove `Hanami::Logger` from `hanami-utils` in favor of `Dry::Logger` from the new `dry-logger` new gem
- Ensure `Hanami::Utils::String.underscore` replaces `"."` (dot character) to `"_"` (underscore)

## 2.0.0 is coming!

**Expect 2.0.0 in two weeks.**

Since the last Hanami beta, weâ€™ve released stable 1.0.0 versions of (almost) all dry-rb gems. The remaining few will come within the next two weeks.

This means that the Ruby ecosystem will soon have a complete set of modern, **stable** libraries and frameworks to build the next generation of applications.

Between now and then, we need your help: please take the chance to test Hanami 2.0! Pull down this RC and give things a go, and let us know if you hit any issues.

## Whatâ€™s included?

Today weâ€™re releasing the following gems:

- hanami v2.0.0.rc1
- hanami-cli v2.0.0.rc1
- hanami-controller v2.0.0.rc1
- hanami-router v2.0.0.rc1
- hanami-validations v2.0.0.rc1
- hanami-reloader v2.0.0.rc1 (it now follows Hanamiâ€™s versioning)
- hanami-rspec v2.0.0.rc1 (it now follows Hanamiâ€™s versioning)

For specific changes in this RC release, please see each gemâ€™s own CHANGELOG.
