Hello again, friends! Weâ€™re excited to share our release of Hanami 2.0.0.beta3!

## Code Reloading

Hanami server and console now support code reloading.

New apps are generated with `hanami-reloader` in `Gemfile` and with a new `Guardfile`.
Code reloading for `hanami server` is based on `guard`.
When the file system changes because of code edits, Guard restarts the Hanami server.

In Hanami 1, we achieved code reloading with an "inside-the-framework" approach that turned to be problematic.
With `hanami-reloader`, we implemented this "outside-the-framework" that has positive implications:

- File system watching is delegated to Guard
- Hanami is now free from code reloading awareness
- Not bundling `hanami-reloader` (e.g. in production), eliminates automatically the code reloading logic
- With `zeitwerk` and `dry-container` we achieved lazy boot of the app, resulting in **very fast code reloading**.

Regarding the Hanami console, we reintroduced `reload` command to be invoked from the console to reload its context.

## Puma

New apps are generated with `puma` in `Gemfile` and with `config/puma.rb` configuration.

## Routes simplification

The routes definition in `config/routes.rb` looks simpler with the elimination of `define` wrapper.

**Before**

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

module Bookshelf
  class Routes < Hanami::Routes
    define do
      root { "Hello from Hanami" }
    end
  end
end
```

**After**

```ruby
# frozen_string_literal: true

module Bookshelf
  class Routes < Hanami::Routes
    root { "Hello from Hanami" }
  end
end
```

## Whatâ€™s included?
