  Some final fixes and polish, along with a preview of our guides.
---

Weâ€™ve had some very helpful testing and feedback since our 2.1.0.rc1 release last week, so today weâ€™re happy to back with an rc2 release, bringing a range of fixes and polish. Weâ€™re also happy to release a preview of our 2.1 guides!

## Fixes

We discovered a couple of blockers for people generating new apps. These are now fixed. `hanami new` will now generate:

- The correct helpers in the default `app/templates/layouts/app.html.erb` layout.
- The proper version string for prerelease versions of our hanami-assets package in `package.json`.

## Polish

We now generate the `"type": "module"` [directive](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#type) in  `package.json`, so front end JavaScript for new Hanami apps will now use [ES modules](https://nodejs.org/api/esm.html) by default. This allows our assets config at `config/assets.js` to use the conventional `.js` file extension, instead of `.mjs` as previously generated.

Our RSpec support has been made friendlier for full stack apps, with [Capybara](https://github.com/teamcapybara/capybara) support now included by default. Our standard RSpec setup in `spec/support/rspec.rb` now includes code comments detailing the purpose of the various configs, making these easier to use or tailor to your preferences.

## Guides

Our guides for 2.1 are close to ready, so weâ€™re happy to [share a preview](https://guides.hanamirb.org/v2.1/introduction/getting-started/) for you to check out.

The guides include a full, test-driven walkthrough of building your first app, either as a full stack web app or an API. If youâ€™ve been interested in checking out Hanami 2.1, this will help you get started! Weâ€™d love to hear your feedback.

## We need your help!

We expect to make our stable 2.1.0 release **just next week!** We consider 2.1.0 to be frozen, and we need your help to shake out any bugs.

Weâ€™d love you to give this release a try, especially for building views and using your favorite front end tools and packages. [Let us know how you go](https://discourse.hanamirb.org).
