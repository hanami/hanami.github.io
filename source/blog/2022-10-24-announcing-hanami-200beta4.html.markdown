  Our last beta! Improved Hanami::Action memory usage, simplified body parser config, and a whole lot of polish.
---

Hello again, friends! Weâ€™re delighted to share the release of Hanami 2.0.0.beta4, the final release of our 2.0.0.beta series!

## Improved memory performance for Hanami::Action

Hanami::Action plays a key role in Hanami 2.0 apps, powering each of your HTTP endpoints. For this release, weâ€™ve made considerable improvements to the memory impact of subclassing Hanami::Action, with a memory reduction of over 5x for each subclass. This will help your Hanami apps retain a slim memory footprint even as they grow in size.

## Simplified body parser config

hanami-routerâ€™s body parsers are the middleware that parse incoming request bodies to turn them into Ruby structures that you can use within your actions. With this release, configuring a body parser has become easier than ever. No more requires or class names, just provide the name for your parser:

```ruby
module MyApp
  class App < Hanami::App
    config.middleware.use :body_parser, :json
  end
end
```

You can now also specify both custom action formats and matching body parser configuration in the same place:

```ruby
module MyApp
  class App < Hanami::App
    config.actions.format json: "application/json+scim"
    config.middleware.use :body_parser, [json: "application/json+scim"]
  end
end
```

## And a whole lot of polish!

Weâ€™ve spent much of this releaseâ€™s development cycle getting everyhing as tidy as possible. Hereâ€™s a few highlights:

- Added helpful output and help messages to all `hanami` CLI commands
- `hanami generate` commands now generate tests for slice-based components under `spec/slices/[slice_name]/`
- `Hanami::Settings` subclasses have a nested dry-types `Types` module auto-generated, for easy type-checking of settings
- `Hanami::Settings#inspect` hides values to prevent leakage of sensitive data, with `#inspect_values` as a way to see everything
- `Hanami.app.configuration` is now `.config`, to better reflect usage in natural language
- `request` and `response` objects inside Hanami::Action now share the same `session` and `flash` objects, ensuring all session changes are persisted regardless of how theyâ€™re made
- Accessing `session` and `flash` now raise a helpful error message if sessions are not configured

## 2.0.0 is coming!

This is the last of our beta releases. From here, we expect to make the following two releases:

- A 2.0.0.rc1 release candidate in two weeks
- The final 2.0.0 release in another two weeks

For these releases, weâ€™ll be focused on minor bug fixes only, plus documentation and the 1.0 releases of our dry-rb gem dependencies. Weâ€™ll also be releasing a preview of our 2.0.0 user guide before the rc1 release.

All of this means you can look forward to a 2.0.0 release towards the end of November!

Between now and then, we need your help: please take the chance to test Hanami 2.0! Pull down this beta and give things a go, and let us know if you hit any issues.
