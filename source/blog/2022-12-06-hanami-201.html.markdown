  Hanami 2.0.1: small enhancements and bug fixes
---

Hello again, friends! Weâ€™re excited to share our release of Hanami 2.0.1!

It ships with small enhancements and minor bug fixes, after our [2.0.0 release](/blog/2022/11/22/announcing-hanami-200/).

## Enhancements and Bug Fixes

  * Ensure `Content-Security-Policy` HTTP response header to be returned as a single line
  * Ensure to load `.env` files during CLI commands execution
  * Ensure `hanami server` to respect HTTP port used in `.env` or the value given as CLI argument (`--port`)
  * Return HTTP response header `Allow` when returning `405` HTTP status
  * Introduce `Hanami::Middleware::BodyParser::FormParser` to parse multipart file upload
  * Make `Hanami::Utils::Callbacks::Chain` and `Hanami::Utils::Callbacks::Callback` comparable via `#==` based on their contents, rather than their object identity

## Released Gems

  * `hanami` `2.0.1`
  * `hanami-reloader` `2.0.1`
  * `hanami-cli` `2.0.1`
  * `hanami-router` `2.0.1`
  * `hanami-utils` `2.0.1`

## How To Upgrade

How to upgrade from a Hanami app:

```shell
$ bundle update hanami-utils hanami-router hanami-cli hanami-reloader hanami
