Hello our beloved Community.

We are thrilled to announce Lotus's very first participation
with [Rails Girls Summer of Code](http://railsgirlssummerofcode.org).

Rails Girls Summer of Code is a 3 months program scholarship for
female students to take part in OSS projects and this year marks
the 3rd year of the program.

As the projector mentor this year, I would like to extend welcome to Inês & Rosa of Team [DEIGirls](https://teams.railsgirlssummerofcode.org/teams/66) from Coimbra, Portugal.
For the next 3 months, I'll be following our students every step to bring to our Community the **mailer** feature.

Mailer feature is planned to be released along with our Lotus v0.5.0 as we've announced in our [roadmap post](http://bit.ly/lotusrb-roadmap-v050) yesterday.
Following our philosophy, mailer library will be delivered as [lotus-mailer](https://github.com/lotus/mailer) gem that can be utilised with any existing Ruby applications, and at the same time as an integrated component of Lotus applications.

Let's see what `lotus-mailer` has to offer. The library will use the battle-tested [mail](https://github.com/mikel/mail) gem by [Mikel Lindsaar](https://github.com/mikel).
It will offer configurable delivery methods, multipart messages, and attachments.
The integration with Lotus applications will be add a new code generator for mailers.

Again, a big shout out to awesome Rails Girls Summer of Code team and to our coaches Tiago Mendes-Costa, Pablo Porto and Christian Weyer.

Please leave your comment of support for our girls this summer :)

Peace out
