## What's Next?

[Since `v1.0.0.beta1`](/blog/2017/02/14/announcing-hanami-100beta1.html), **Hanami API's are stable and won't be changed until 2.0**.

We'll keep to release small _beta_/_rc_ versions to integrate fixes for reported bugs.

The final stable release (`v1.0.0`) will happen between the end of March and the beginning of April 2017, which coincides with the [Hanami season in Japan](http://www.japan-guide.com/sakura/). ðŸŒ¸
