Hello wonderful community!

We would like to improve our documentation in October and we need your help. 🙌

Make a contribution to the [Hanami guides](http://hanamirb.org/guides/) in the following repository: [https://github.com/hanami/hanami.github.io](https://github.com/hanami/hanami.github.io).

Every contribution will be awarded with new (and improved) Hanami stickers. Very eager contributors will receive larger gadgets, such as t-shirts.

Do you need some inspiration? Maybe have a look at [these ideas](https://github.com/hanami/hanami.github.io/issues), or write about repositories, and validations.

We appreciate every contribution ❤️.
